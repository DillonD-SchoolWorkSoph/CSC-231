6.  Statement:  The number of full nodes (node with two children) plus one is equal to the number of leaves in a nonempty binary tree.
	Induction Hypothesis:  Asume you have so arbitary tree were the number of full nodes is , wheh K is equal to one then you will have a single full node, with two children these two childredn are leaves of the binary tree.  So the number of full nodes is 1, and the leaves are 2, so K+1 is equal to the number of leaves of the tree.
	Induction Step:
Now if you have if you have K + 1 Nodes, then you will have K nodes + 1, and since the kth node will be conected to the plus one node, then you know that the number of leaves will be k+1, plus the 1th one node for the 1th full node.
