For drill two swap_v would compile for all cases since the inside function is working with a copy of each variable so any changes made would be to the copy.  swap_r would not work when you send refrences of the constants since you are atempting to modify constants inside the funtion.  Swap_cr would not work for any cases since the paremters are constants theirfor no modifications inside of the fucntion can occur.
